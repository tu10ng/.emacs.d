* emacs
this is my personal emacs configuration directory.

[[file:myinit.org][file:myinit.org]]

#+begin_src 
  ___ _ __ ___   __ _  ___ ___ 
 / _ \ '_ ` _ \ / _` |/ __/ __|
|  __/ | | | | | (_| | (__\__ \
 \___|_| |_| |_|\__,_|\___|___/

#+end_src                               

* installation
need manually download [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/lazycat-theme.git][lazycat-theme]] and [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/awesome-tray.git][awesome-tray]].
(I'm lazy enough not adding auto installation for this.)
(actually I'm afraid the slow connection of github will introduce bugs)

* usage
some keybindings have been changed:
M-i = C-x o since M-i isn't bound on any key.
M-u, M-l, M-c will take effect backwards instead of forwards.
M-o open line above, etc.

* todo
this configuration is basicly just a set of `use-package's, bear my poor programming skill.
